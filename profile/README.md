## Hi there üëã

![A cover image depicting a book with the title "Engineering Collaboration"](assets/cover.webp)

My name is [Daniel Lanner](https://github.com/daniellanner). I am the original author and maintainer of *Engineering Collaboration*. A book for modern software engineering companies on software development teams and digital market competitiveness.

I penned the first notes of this book in early 2021. The scope, structure, and spirit of the book shifted over the years but has now settled into a stable shape.

*Engineering Collaboration* is written open source with permissive licensing and distributed free of charge to empower software teams across the globe. With some luck these teams will reap some benefit from this book and accelerate their development practices.

## Contributions

Barring one or two additions, all chapters of the book's two-part structure are available, although with various levels of refinement. I am currently rearranging, rewriting, and restoring the chapters for an engaging reading experience.

Should you uncover any mistakes in spelling, grammar, or find yourself disagreeing with me on any chapter open an issue on the repository and become a contributor to this book.
